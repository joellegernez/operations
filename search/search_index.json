Upon review of the Bridge Foundry 501(c)3 application with the Bridge Foundry Transition Board, Sarah Allen assumed her role as chair of the meeting and noting the presence of a quorum [of the Bridge Foundry Board of Directors] called the meeting to order at 7:15 p.m. The board reviewed the statement of work for the contract between Bridge Foundry and Enrich for Diana Luepke to serve as Acting COO through November 2016 to help establish governance and manage operations for the transition. The contract will be finalized by Sarah Allen, as CEO, after legal review. Attached is the document - Transition Consulting, Acting-COO Compensation - which Sarah Allen prepared documenting research that informed compensation for the Enrich contract. The board discussed oversight of work by Enrich, and delegated such oversight to Sarah Allen as CEO, including future contract extensions or amendments. [RESOLVED] The board reviewed and accepted the Gift Policy. RESOLVED: that Bridge Foundry is committed to creating a sustainable organization and, in support of that goal, all decisions governing how compensation is determined and the selection process for vendors, employees and contractors will be summarized and stored in its virtual office. RESOLVED: the Bridge Foundry virtual office shall have a publicly readable index that references private and public information. The index will be linked to from Bridge Foundry's public website.

Her proposal is to charge us the same rate that she charges all of her clients, including School Factory ($40/hour). According to payscale.com ^1 , the hourly rate for non-profit COO is $10-$45/hour (10th - 90th percentile) with a median rate of $30/hour. While $40/hour is at the high end of that range, typically this would be an employee role with payroll taxes covered and sometimes benefits. In this case, she is a contractor so bears the additional expenses herself. We believe that her deep experience with our organization and proven efficiency will significantly reduce the number of hours required for this transition work. Also, though the statement of work does not require someone with her level of experience, we value the strategic consulting that she can offer during the process, as we set up our new Board of Directors in parallel with the transition engagement.

You will know when it goes out, because we cc you on the email as well. If you don't see the invoice go out within a few days, feel free to follow up with us at finance@bridgefoundry.org. Please complete one form for each sponsor/payment. Payment Methods The sponsor may pay by any of the following methods once they receive the invoice: Check (default option; no fee) ACH (integrated into invoice if requested; flat 50\u00a2 fee) Credit card (integrated into invoice if requested; 3.40% + 25\u00a2 fee) PayPal (not preferred but an option if they ask; your group absorbs 2.2% + 30\u00a2 fee) When you fill out the Invoice Request Form, you can select which payment options you want activated on the invoice. In order to maximize your donation, we recommend either leaving the credit option off or asking them if they will consider covering the fees. Many sponsors prefer the convenience of credit card transactions and are happy to pay a few dollars more to cover the transaction fee, in which case we can include that as an additional line item on the invoice. Payment Follow Up Once you submit an invoice request, we will follow up to ensure payment comes through. After about a month with no payment, we remind the sponsor about paying After about 2 months with no payment, we will ask you to follow up with the sponsor directly If you are curious about the status of the payment at any time, you can click on the original emailed invoice (it will be marked \"Paid\" in big letters if we have received payment). If a donor check or payment is not received prior to an upcoming workshop, don\u2019t worry! We will advance funds from the Bridge Foundry general fund to cover your expenses until we receive payment. Paperwork Sometimes sponsors want us to fill out special vendor paperwork, get set up in their ACH system, provide a W9, or prove our 501c3 status.

We ask that chapters and communities within our network explain this to donors appropriately. What is an unrestricted donation? \"Unrestricted\" funds are donations a nonprofit may use for any purpose. When donations are made to Bridge Foundry for a specific program, chapter, community, or purpose, we do set aside those funds for the intended purpose. We communicate up front with donors that the funds are unrestricted just in case funds need to be reallocated down the road. If I donate money to support a specific event or community, why would it go elsewhere? We have a very small part-time staff and all of our work is accomplished by volunteers, student participants and independent communities who use our open source materials. When a volunteer raises funds with the goal of enabling a local community, we have processes in place to support that specific local community using those funds as much as possible; however, we do not formally restrict those funds to allow for flexibility if more money is raised than needed for a specific event (so volunteers can use it for a future event), for those rare cases where an active local volunteer might move away with no successor, or for other circumstances that make it impractical for us to spend funds as originally designated. There may be a very active volunteer elsewhere who could make a big impact with those funds, and if that ever were to happen, then we would want you to support that without needing to contact you to discuss the change.

Most Bridges follow the original RailsBridge \u201cviral workshop\u201d model with open source curriculum and in-person events. Students become TAs become Teachers. The best teachers are those who have learned most recently, and have a passion for giving back to a community that fostered their own development. Companies benefit when we expand the talent pool, and their staff who volunteer at workshops become more expert through teaching and improving their leadership and communication skills. Bridge leaders are encouraged to innovate with new techniques for creating diverse and inclusive communities, for example, the GoBridge podcast and Slack community. When curricula are developed for a programming language or subject matter area or volunteers start to engage in this work, we traditionally choose a name that includes the word \u201cBridge.\u201d For example, our curriculum for Ruby on Rails is referred to as \u201cRailsBridge.\u201d Naming note: so we can explore IP protections and in the future accept checks for any Bridge, we consider all the Bridge names are technically synonymous with Bridge Foundry. Overview The current structure of our organization is illustrated in Bridge Foundry Operations Overview The officers and board of directors are identified in our corporate docs Roles Volunteer Bridge Leader Separate from the creation and availability of curricula for a particular technology, volunteers may opt to create a Bridge leadership board, so they may promote use of a particular curriculum and provide deeper guidance and support for curriculum users. Bridge Leaders complete our Volunteer Agreement , which references specific Bridge Leader Policies . Independent Community Most of the groups we work with are Independent Communities (usually referred to as \u201cCommunities\u201d for short). Communities use a Bridge curriculum, agree to our Workshop Guidelines, and align themselves publicly with Bridge Foundry by using one of our official names (like RailsBridge, ClojureBridge, etc). They are not legally part of Bridge Foundry, Inc. but we support them in a variety of ways, as requested, including guidance, grants, and access to our online resources. Chapter Chapters have a lot in common with Communities. They agree to our Workshop Guidelines and use a version of one of our official names. They can access the same resources like fundraising advice and use of Bridge Troll . They also have some additional benefits: Access to finance infrastructure, such as corporate cards and online donation processing through their website Access to the benefits of being part of a nonprofit organization, which can include things like discounts and access to some in-kind gifts In the future, active Bridge Foundry Chapters will also be covered by our liability insurance, in the unlikely event that there\u2019s some kind of legal action. In order to become a Chapter, groups will: Have one or more leaders who make a commitment to lead the chapter (for at least one year) Have some track record with the organization and plan to hold at least 2 events in the upcoming year Complete our Volunteer Agreement Meet with their Bridge leader and/or a volunteer mentor once a year to share knowledge about successes and challenges Chapters typically have one or more volunteer fundraisers (see below). Chapter Leaders complete our Volunteer Agreement , which references specific Chapter Leader Policies . Program Sometimes we support groups that don\u2019t follow the Bridge model for engaging underrepresented communities, but are clearly mission aligned. Women Who Go is an example of this type of program currently; Test First Teaching and the Teaching Kids initiative are past programs that are not currently active. While their needs are slightly different, programs like these generally follow our operational guidelines for fundraising and expenses, as well as following our Code of Conduct or approved equivalent. They may also have an opportunity to access the additional resources available for Chapters (as a \u201cProgram\u201d) provided that they have active leadership in place and we have capacity to support them. Leaders of Programs that operate as a legal part of Bridge Foundry, Inc. (similar to Chapters) complete our Volunteer Agreement , which references specific Program Leader Policies . Volunteer Fundraiser Volunteer fundraisers are just what they sound like: individuals can help raise money generally for Bridge Foundry, or specifically for a Community, Chapter, Program, or Bridge. The main caveat is that all funds raised technically need to be unrestricted funds to allow the organization to act when volunteers become inactive. (\u201cUnrestricted\u201d is a technical term in the fundraising world that indicates the money can be used generally to support our mission, rather than needing to track and report on funds allocated and spent for very specific purposes.) Volunteer Fundraisers complete our Volunteer Agreement , which references specific fundraising policies . Common Questions International groups We have inspired a global movement, with workshops using Bridge curriculum offered around the world. Yet there are logistical limits to the activities our formal US corporation can directly pursue in other countries. At this time, we are not able to legally operate in other countries, so international groups cannot become Chapters. We also cannot provide grants to individuals in other countries, so international Communities aren\u2019t currently eligible for financial grants.

We also provide grants to both Chapters and Communities that are having trouble locating a sponsor. These grants are approved on a first-come basis.

Most Bridges follow the original RailsBridge \u201cviral workshop\u201d model with open source curriculum and in-person events. Students become TAs become Teachers. The best teachers are those who have learned most recently, and have a passion for giving back to a community that fostered their own development. Companies benefit when we expand the talent pool, and their staff who volunteer at workshops become more expert through teaching and improving their leadership and communication skills. Bridge leaders are encouraged to innovate with new techniques for creating diverse and inclusive communities, for example, the GoBridge podcast and Slack community. When curricula are developed for a programming language or subject matter area or volunteers start to engage in this work, we traditionally choose a name that includes the word \u201cBridge.\u201d For example, our curriculum for Ruby on Rails is referred to as \u201cRailsBridge.\u201d Naming note: so we can explore IP protections and in the future accept checks for any Bridge, we consider all the Bridge names are technically synonymous with Bridge Foundry.","title":"Background"},{"location":"roles/#overview","text":"The current structure of our organization is illustrated in Bridge Foundry Operations Overview The officers and board of directors are identified in our corporate docs","title":"Overview"},{"location":"roles/#roles","text":"","title":"Roles"},{"location":"roles/#volunteer-bridge-leader","text":"Separate from the creation and availability of curricula for a particular technology, volunteers may opt to create a Bridge leadership board, so they may promote use of a particular curriculum and provide deeper guidance and support for curriculum users.

This agreement does not imply that their Community\u2019s activities are part of Bridge Foundry\u2019s legal operations. Volunteer Term Volunteer Fundraisers have a term of one year (365 days). If they wish to continue raising funds after a year, Bridge Foundry will ask them to complete another Volunteer Agreement. This is for multiple reasons: so that we have an accurate record of the current number of Volunteer Fundraisers with up-to-date contact information and to ensure that everyone remembers what they have agreed. Bridge Foundry's Responsibilities During your term as Volunteer Fundraiser (as long as you follow policies), Bridge Foundry will: Provide materials about Bridge Foundry that you can use in conversations with donors Answer your questions about processing donations Allocate funds you raise to the chapter, program, or purpose indicated on the volunteer agreement as long as there are active volunteers who need funding for mission-aligned activities, consistent with our operational policies. Volunteer Fundraiser's Responsibilities: By signing the Volunteer Agreement, Volunteer Fundraisers agree to: Explain to donors that donations are technically raised as \u201cunrestricted funds,\u201d which Bridge Foundry will apply for the specific purpose you\u2019re raising them for to the extent practical and that they may also be applied to other activities in support of Bridge Foundry\u2019s mission if there are leftover funds or a group of volunteers becomes inactive. (See \u201cunrestricted funds\u201d note below.) If any online fundraising component is approved for my fundraising campaign, include specific language provided by Bridge Foundry on the campaign page about the funds being unrestricted Refrain from soliciting particular donors if requested by Bridge Foundry (See \"solicitation limitations\" note below.) Gather the donor\u2019s legal name, address, and email (for companies, gather a legal company name and a contact person name) Direct donors to one of Bridge Foundry\u2019s approved online giving portals or submit an invoice request so they can pay Bridge Foundry directly. Volunteer Fundraisers may not accept cash, checks or other forms of payment directly from the donor. (See \"payment methods\" note below.) Coordinate with Bridge Foundry staff for any solicitations for Bridge Foundry general funds (vs. for a specific purpose, chapter or community) Let Bridge Foundry know if they want to raise funds using a platform, payment method or approach that is different from the primary methods the organization explicitly supports (as described in this Operations Guide). If Bridge Foundry indicates that we aren\u2019t able to support that method currently, agree not to raise funds that way. If Bridge Foundry does approve the method, communicate with Bridge Foundry staff, who will set up any required accounts. Volunteer Fundraisers do not have authority to bind the organization into agreements or open accounts in its name. Example: If I wanted to do a Kickstarter or Indiegogo campaign, Bridge Foundry would need to discuss and determine whether they could support that well in advance of launching the campaign. Notes Unrestricted Funds: While most Volunteer Fundraisers step into this role to help raise money for a specific activity, chapter, community, or program, it\u2019s important for us to explain to donors that these funds are unrestricted. That\u2019s because it gives Bridge Foundry freedom to use the money as makes sense without checking back in with the donor. For example, if you have leftover money from one workshop, we can apply it to the next one. If your chapter or community becomes inactive and it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to start back up but it still has some money leftover, we have the ability to use that money to support a new group somewhere else. And, if we don\u2019t have a good reason like this to move the money around, we aren\u2019t going to. We appreciate your efforts in helping communicate this balanced view: that on the whole the money will be used for the purpose you are describing to the donor, and we may reallocate it to other mission-aligned activities under certain circumstances. Solicitation limitations: We plan in the near future to define some sponsorship guidelines, including some indicators of how to avoid partnering with companies or individuals who are not aligned with our mission. We may also coordinate centralized giving from major donors, and we may ask you to coordinate with us if you have an idea for how to engage with specific companies. These are both examples of cases in which we may, in the future, ask Volunteer Fundraisers not to solicit some donors. Payment methods: Volunteer fundraisers primarily solicit donations from corporate donors and then request that Bridge Foundry send them an invoice, which they can then pay via check, credit card, or ACH payment. If other methods of accepting funds are desired, we can discuss options, but Bridge Foundry needs to accept the donations directly. We expect acceptance of ongoing donations through a donation portal on websites to be available to Chapters soon.","title":"Volunteer fundraiser policies"},{"location":"roles/volunteer-fundraiser-policies/#volunteer-fundraiser-policies","text":"","title":"Volunteer Fundraiser Policies"},{"location":"roles/volunteer-fundraiser-policies/#definition-of-role","text":"Volunteer Fundraiser is a role that allows individuals to do fundraising for activities within Bridge Foundry\u2019s wide network of impact.

As a program of School Factory, Bridge Foundry and its sub-organizations must conduct activities and spend money only in support of its mission within IRS guidelines. Bridge Foundry Mission: Empower people with technology through teaching and facilitating access, enlarging the community of people who give back and teach others. Definitions Bridge Foundry (\u201cFoundry\u201d) is the support team for all the Bridges and their Chapters and free-form volunteer efforts. The Foundry is led by a Program Director and representative board. Bridge, in this document refers to a self-governing Bridge with its own board. Each bridge focuses on a specific technology, or set of technologies, and shares open source curriculum and program materials across geographies. Bridge leaders may add new Chapters and Chapter leaders. Sometimes people organize a single event or initiative for a new technology, independent of a Bridge and that is fine. Chapter: a regional, technology-specific group which has held at least one event. Each Chapter belongs to a Bridge. An active Chapter has one or more leaders, who might do fundraising and can approve expenses if the Chapter has a budget. Chapter leaders can also have the ability to approve or edit events for their chapter and add/remove leaders for their chapter. Operations Bridge Foundry is run by a small operations team, including a part time Operations Manager (operations@bridgefoundry.org) with accounting, legal, and advisory support from School Factory. New Bridges can be created by anyone who wants to offer programs that are aligned with our mission. For more detail see how to make a bridge . Event Organizing We have an open source event registration system, Bridge Troll , which has been developed by RailsBridge volunteers. While many leaders use Meetup or EventBrite to organize events, we developed Bridge Troll as a way to effectively manage separate lists of volunteers and students, allowing for ongoing profiles and tracking of history, which is not well-supported by other online tools. We strongly encourage all volunteers who are organizing events to use Bridge Troll. Please file an issue or join the mailing list if you have feedback. To learn more about it, please check out the wiki . Finance Directing Funds It is our policy that the group (Foundry, Bridge or Chapter) that raises funds, gets to direct how the funds are spent; however, donations must be provided without restriction to Bridge Foundry, so as to streamline our internal processes (more on that below). We often communicate our intentions to sponsors and report on our progress, but it is important that those reports are not a formal commitment to allocate an exact amount of money to a specific program. This allows the leadership of the Foundry, Bridge or Chapter the flexibility to reallocate funds as needed. When volunteers or staff raise funds via Bridge Foundry, they will associate the donation(s) with a specific Workshop, Chapter, Bridge, or Bridge Foundry. All funds must be spent only on educational and charitable activities that are aligned with our mission. All expenses must be approved by a Workshop or Chapter leader, a Bridge board member, or a designated volunteer or staff person. Allowed Expenses Any Bridge or Chapter will utilize funds only for charitable and educational activities consistent with our tax-exempt status described above. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the Bridge will not intervene in any election or support or oppose any political party or candidate for public office, or engage in any lobbying not permitted by section 501(c)(3) of the IRC, or, if applicable, IRC 501\u00a7\u00a7(h) and 4911. Bridges or Chapters will not endorse political candidates or parties. Financial Guidance The Finance Committee is composed of staff and volunteers.

Important: Please follow instructions on how to use funds for information about how to submit receipts. Who may request a grant Any organizer who wants to hold a Bridge workshop that supports the Bridge Foundry mission. The organizer must be either a known and experienced organizer, or must be approved by a known chapter leader or experienced volunteer organizer. Standard criteria budget is within normal parameters for the region expenses are for normal recommended workshop things; see list of typical expenses We welcome innovative ideas. Don't be deterred if your plan is not typical -- all of our work started with a-typical ideas. Approval process Grant applications are evaluated within a calendar week of submission. If funds are available, first-time grant applications for Bridge workshops that meet standard criteria by an approved organizer are dispensed without further evaluation. If grant applications exceed current funding, the Bridge Foundry program director will assess impact and make a decision or raise additional funds to cover all applications. Post-Event When you do receive funding from Bridge Foundry, we ask that you simply write a short blog post after your event on the Bridge Foundry blog about how the grant helped you and your community hold the workshop and the difference it has made.

We raise funds in a few different ways: * Sponsorship * Individual Donations * Employer Match * Crowdfunding Campaigns * Revenue sharing Sponsorship Typically, a sponsor asks for an invoice OR says that they will send a check (we'll invoice them just to streamline our process and be able to track who is actually doing what.) A Bridge member or workshop organizer submits an invoice request on behalf of the sponsor. Upon receiving the Bridge Foundry invoice, the sponsor submits the payment to Bridge Foundry. Bridge Foundry's bookkeeper adds the amount to the Bridge or chapter fund . For information about how a Bridge member or organizer can withdraw funds, please see our instructions for using funds .

You can: - Embed a form directly on your website, like this - Embed a button on your website that pops open the form - Request a hosted donations page if you don\u2019t have your own website For any of these options, complete the Flipcause Integration Request Form and we will send you the code to embed in your own https-enabled website (not available for custom domains via github pages, but free on Firebase hosting) and/or the link for the hosted page. Flipcause charges a fee of 4.9% + 30 cents per transaction, which they allow the donor to pay. Most donors choose to pay the fee, but if they decline to do so the amount of money you receive will be lessened by that amount. For this reason, we still recommend larger donors mail a check or you request an invoice as explained on the sponsorship page, and ask them to pay via check or ACH. Online payments using Flipcause integration are great for smaller individual donations, especially if a donor is interested in setting up a recurring payment. We will follow up with you within a week of receiving the integration request. Feel free to email finance@bridgefoundry.org if you don\u2019t hear back or have questions. Crowdfunding Campaigns We use Flipcause for crowdfunding campaigns. If you are interested in running a crowdfunding campaign, please fill out the Flipcause Integration Request Form and select the crowdfunding campaign type. We will also need the following additional information before we can launch the campaign: - A list of all the giving levels you want to use and any rewards for each one - The fair market value of each reward - All the text you want to use for the campaign description Once we receive the completed Flipcause Integration Request Form , we will follow up with you to get this additional information. Since crowdfunding campaigns have the most moving parts to setup and test, please allow at least 2 weeks to get the campaign ready for launch after you have submitted the request form. We may also need to email back and forth a few times to clarify some of the reward value details, so your responsiveness will make a difference in how quickly the campaign can launch. Before you publicize your page, please reach out to us to test it. There are a lot of small pieces of text that are in the email response and social sharing, that are hard to review until it is live.

If you do not receive an Expensify confirmation that you have been added to the \u201cBridge Foundry Policy\u201d within that time frame, please email finance@bridgefoundry.org. \u200bYou can sign in with an existing account like Google or set up a username and password. Add your bank account (do this before submitting your report to get paid faster!) The bank account information should belong to the individual who is requesting reimbursement -- or who you would like the reimbursement to go to. Your chapter does not need a bank account to do this, but any organizer who wants to be reimbursed does. For your protection, we recommend that individuals sign up for their own account and enter their own bank information. Click on the icon in the upper right corner of the screen and select \"Personal Settings\". On the right side of the screen, select \"Reimbursement\", then add a deposit account. You will need your routing and account numbers. Once the account is added, Expensify will make three deposits into your account that you will need to verify in order to receive reimbursement via the account. Report Submission Requirements When submitting reports, the following must be included to receive reimbursement: For workshop expenses, include the date(s) of the workshop in the report name. Select an expense category and a tag (your chapter name or general fund) for each individual expense. List specifics in the Comment field for expenses in the Other category. All expenses must have itemized receipts attached. (Include both itemized receipt and payment receipt if tips included in final total. Use our template for on-site service providers if they don't provide receipts.) Invoices that don't list an amount paid do not count as receipts. We need to see that you paid the invoice. Expenses must be for a chapter or fund you are approved to submit expenses for, and must follow our allowed expense guidelines. You must have a bank account set up with Expensify (or PayPal outside of the US). To Submit Expenses for Reimbursement Create a new report and add all expenses to be reimbursed, following all the guidelines under \u201crequirements\u201d above. See examples in screen shot below: Submit the report using the button near the top left of the screen. If you haven\u2019t already, add a bank account so you can receive payment. You will receive an email when the expense report has been approved. Feel free to email us at finance@bridgefoundry.org if you aren\u2019t seeing approval come through within a week of submission. If you haven\u2019t added a bank account yet when the report is approved, Expensify will send you an email asking you to add an account. You won\u2019t get paid until you have added an account. PLEASE NOTE that if you DO NOT select the \"Bridge Foundry\" policy in the upper right hand corner of the report, it won't be submitted to us and we will not receive notification that you've submitted a report. ACH payments will generally be processed on Mondays and will arrive in your bank account about one week later. To prevent delay of your reimbursement, please ensure your bank account information is included on your login. To Submit a Report to Reimburse Someone Else Since ACH is the fastest way to get reimbursed via Expensify's secure system, we encourage each volunteer to submit their own reports and bank information. On the rare occasion you need to submit a reimbursement for someone else on your organizing team, please do the following (note that this may slow reimbursement down since we are goign to be working outside Expensify): Submit the report in Expensify following the instructions above, so the receipts are all in one place If the reimbursement should go to someone else, please include their name in the report name Make a comment at the bottom of the report with the name and postal address of the volunteer who should be sent a check. International Payments If you are located outside of the United States, follow the same instructions for submitting a report, but make sure to select the correct currency for each expense. The system will automatically convert it to US dollars. You won\u2019t be able to add a bank account for ACH reimbursement though, so email us at finance@bridgefoundry.org to let us know you need the payment via PayPal.

Everyone in [*Bridge] is a volunteer, and our funding comes mostly from technology companies working with us to improve diversity in the tech community. What is a Preferred Vendor? In locations where we hold workshops repeatedly, we're developing relationships with companies that provide meals and childcare for the workshops. This established relationship makes it easier for volunteers workshop organizers and for vendors who do business with [*Bridge]. We'll try to set a standard order for Preferred Vendors that can be scaled up or down for the headcount of a given workshop. After that, for each workshop, a workshop organizer will provide the headcount and workshop location. We would like to make the experience for [*Bridge] Preferred Vendors as seamless as possible. Please give us feedback if something is difficult or inconvenient from your side; the best email for that feedback is [your email here]. How does [*Bridge] pay for the workshops' food and childcare?

Receipts for all expenses must reflect the dollar amount, proof of payment, and an itemized list of the items purchased.

Transfers are subject to a one week bank transfer delay, so please plan ahead! Your card can have a maximum of $3,000 on it at any given time. This policy exists to minimize financial risk from stolen cards and/or fraudulent charges. If you expect to need a lot of funds in a short time, let us know how much you will need overall and then communicate as you spend funds and need more added. Monitor your funds: You can check your account balance by logging in here: https://ch.pexcard.com/ The balance on our master accounting spreadsheet reflects total available funds, including what is on your Pex card. It does not indicate how much is on the card. You must make a request for us to transfer funds to Pex. Reporting: Be sure to submit an expense report every month that there are any charges on the card. The report is due within 5 days of the end of the month. Failure to submit an expense report on time or any misuse of funds may result in the revocation of PEX Card privileges.","title":"Use Guidelines"},{"location":"using-funds/direct-pay/","text":"Direct Pay Bridge Foundry is able to pay vendors directly for Chapters and Bridges. This option is not available to Independent Communities. Invoicing Bridge Foundry Vendors can invoice Bridge Foundry directly by mailing the invoice to us: Bridge Foundry 340 S Lemon Ave #3994N Walnut, CA 91789 finance@bridgefoundry.org Please let us know if you expect a vendor to invoice us. The invoice from the vendor should also list your Chapter or Bridge name. Calling in Card Info In the rare circumstance that a Chapter or Bridge isn't able to use a corporate card or arrange for invoicing and can't afford to be reimbursed, we may be able to call your vendor with credit card information to arrange for faster payment. We do need advanced notice for this; allow a week but if you're in a jam reach out and we will do our best. Contact us at finance@bridgefoundry.org to inquire about this option. Preferred vendors We believe we can reduce the burden on future volunteers by establishing relationships, standard pricing and common menu choices with preferred vendors. Many companies will also extend discounts to non-profit organizations, a benefit which may be easier to activate by setting up a standing vendor relationship. We are interested in exploring this approach more and would love your participation in trying it out. We prefer to support local, independent businesses whenever possible and we are happy to support you in building relationships with them. When you contact a vendor with whom you'd like to set up a Preferred Vendor relationship, we recommend including a copy of the FAQ below. Make sure to replace each instance of [*Bridge] with your Chapter name and fill in the \"Local Bridge Contact\" with your info before you send it to someone! [*Bridge] Preferred Vendor FAQs What is [*Bridge]? [*Bridge] is a group that hosts free workshops each year to help people level up with programming technologies. Our focus is on increasing diversity in tech, and making the tech community a welcoming place for everyone. Everyone in [*Bridge] is a volunteer, and our funding comes mostly from technology companies working with us to improve diversity in the tech community. What is a Preferred Vendor? In locations where we hold workshops repeatedly, we're developing relationships with companies that provide meals and childcare for the workshops. This established relationship makes it easier for volunteer workshop organizers and for vendors who do business with us. We'll try to set a standard order for Preferred Vendors that can be scaled up or down for the headcount of a given workshop. After that, for each workshop, a workshop organizer will provide the headcount and workshop location. We would like to make the experience for [*Bridge] Preferred Vendors as seamless as possible. Please give us feedback if something is difficult or inconvenient from your side; the best email for that feedback is [your email here]. How do vendors get paid? We are part of Bridge Foundry, a 501c3 nonprofit organization. Bridge Foundry processes payments for us, so please invoice them and reference [*Bridge] somewhere on the invoice. You can send an invoice to: Email: finance@bridgefoundry.org (preferred) Mail: Bridge Foundry, 340 S Lemon Ave #3994N, Walnut, CA 91789 How long should payment take? The turn-around time from invoicing Bridge Foundry is a maximum of 3 weeks. Under special circumstances, we may be able to turn around payment more quickly, but we can only commit to that with prior arrangement. Who should I first contact with invoicing questions? Contact Bridge Foundry's finance department at finance@bridgefoundry.org. How should I escalate invoicing questions? Every Preferred Vendor has a local [*Bridge] contact. (It's probably the person sending you this FAQ.) If you have a problem interacting with Bridge Foundry directly, please contact your local contact.

Please note Bridge Foundry Inc. only provides reimbursement to individuals that are U.S. residents. Contact us at hello@bridgefoundry.org if you would like support us in creating an international reimbursement policy. Expense report submissions are done via Expensify. Our goal is to make this easy for volunteers. If any of this presents a hardship, please let us know ! We're always looking for ways to streamline our processes. In addition to following the directions below for getting set up on Expensify initially, we encourage you to bookmark this page and review the \"Submitting Reports\" section each time you submit a report, as there are important reminders included. Get Set Up On Expensify (One time) Complete and submit this form . Once you have received an email from Expensify notifying you that you have been added to the \u201cBridge Foundry Policy,\u201d create an account on Expensify. You can sign in with an existing account like Google or set up a username and password. (You should be set up within two business days. If you do not receive an Expensify confirmation that you have been added to the \u201cBridge Foundry Policy\u201d within that time frame, please email finance@bridgefoundry.org.) If you are getting reimbursed, add your bank account (do this before submitting your report to get paid faster!) The bank account information should belong to the individual who is requesting reimbursement. Each individual that needs reimbursement generally signs up for their own account and enters their own bank information. If you need to submit a report on someone else's behalf, however, see the instructions at the bottom of this page. Here's how to add the bank account for your own reimbursements: Click on the icon in the upper right corner of the screen and select \"Personal Settings\". On the right side of the screen, select \"Reimbursement\", then add a deposit account. You will need your routing and account numbers. Once the account is added, Expensify will make three deposits into your account that you will need to verify in order to receive reimbursement via the account. Submitting Reports Create a new report and add your expenses: For workshop expenses, include the date(s) of the workshop in the report name. Check the \"reimburseable\" box on each expense that you paid out of pocket and uncheck the box for Pex card expenses. Select an expense category and a tag (your chapter/community name or general fund) for each individual expense. List specifics in the Comment field for expenses in the Other category. Double check that your report meets the following criteria - these are required for reimbursement! All expenses must have itemized receipts attached. (Include both itemized receipt and payment receipt if tips included in final total. Invoices that don't list an amount paid do not count as receipts. We need to see that you paid the invoice. Use our template for on-site service providers if they don't provide receipts.) See note at the bottom of this page about how to submit multiple receipts! Expenses must be for a chapter or fund for which you are approved to submit expenses, and must follow our approved expenses policy Submit the report using the button near the top left of the screen. If you haven\u2019t already, add a bank account so you can receive payment. (For those getting reimbursed.) You will receive an email when the expense report has been approved. Feel free to email us at finance@bridgefoundry.org if you aren\u2019t seeing approval come through within a week of submission. PLEASE NOTE that if you DO NOT select the \"Bridge Foundry\" policy in the upper right hand corner of the report, it won't be submitted to us and we will not receive notification that you've submitted a report. For those getting reimbursed, ACH payments will arrive in your bank account about one week after approval. Attaching Multiple Receipts For expenses that require multiple attachments, there are two ways to approach this: Combine all receipts for that expense into a single document and then upload that for the receipt. We will scroll through when reviewing the receipts. Or, include additional receipts/documents at the bottom of the report as \"attachments.\" If it looks like something is missing, we will check the attachments before asking you about it.
